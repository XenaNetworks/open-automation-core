About XOA Core
==============

Xena OpenAutomation Core (:term:`XOA` Core) is the framework that provides a standardized way for developers and test specialists to execute, develop, and integrate test suites, as well as managing Xena's physical and virtual Traffic Generation and Analysis (:term:`TGA`) testers.

We open the source code of XOA Core to the public to empower our users with the freedom to tailor the code to their unique needs, develop and integrate their own test suites, so that XOA Core not only works with Xena-developed test suites.

All of Xena-developed test suites are in this repository: `XOA Test Suites <https://github.com/xenanetworks/open-automation-test-suites>`_.

XOA Core uses `XOA Python API <https://github.com/xenanetworks/open-automation-python-api>`_ as the driver to administer Xena's physical and virtual testers.
