    Resource Manager
        XOA Python API HL-API provides an easy way to manage subtester test resources, including obtaining test resources and managing indices. 
    
    Module Manager
        A Module Manager helps you access test modules. There is one Module Manager per tester.

    Port Manager
        A Port Managers helps you access test ports. There is one Port Manager per test module.

    Index Manager
        An Index Manager manages the subport-level resource indices such as stream indices, filter indices, connection group indices, match term indices, length term indices, etc. It automatically ensures correct and conflict-free index assignment.

    IDE
        An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
